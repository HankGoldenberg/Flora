        Electric vehicles are an essential technology for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but operators are also experimenting with other green technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells and biomethane models. The ZeEUS report shows that some 25 European cities plan to have a total of 2,500 electric buses operating by 2020, and Norway plans to phase out all fossil-fuel-powered vehicles by 2025. It seems that a full switch to low-carbon energy is finally in sight.

      Since they say their buses will save their owner $700,000 in fuel and maintenance savings over a 12-year period, we can infer that their capital cost is $700,000 more than a diesel bus. Of course, this does not include the cost of necessary charging stations, which can be up to $50,000 each.As the technology advances and the electric bus is put into more widespread use one would expect their cost to come down, but we could not imagine the initial cost to ever be anywhere near the cost of a diesel vehicle. </p>
